# Project Insights
1. Academic Performance is Significantly Affected

Approximately 74% of students show academic performance impact due to social media addiction.

 2. Mental Health Correlation

Students with higher addiction scores tend to cluster around mid-to-high mental health risk levels.

3. Sleep Reduction Pattern

- Sleep hours decline significantly at higher engagement levels.
- High school students show the lowest cumulative sleep duration.

 4. Gender Usage Trends

Female students show slightly higher average daily usage hours compared to males in key age brackets.

5. High-Risk Platforms

Instagram and TikTok contribute the highest addiction scores.
Facebook and WhatsApp follow closely.

6. Conflict Trends

Certain countries show higher social media conflict frequency, indicating cultural or behavioral patterns.

# Recommendations
Introduce digital wellness education in schools

Encourage time-limited platform usage

Promote parental awareness programs

Integrate mental health monitoring systems

Develop platform-specific awareness campaigns

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analytics can uncover hidden behavioral patterns in student populations.

The analysis reveals a clear relationship between:

High social media usage

Increased addiction scores

Reduced sleep duration

Academic performance decline

Mental health strain

By leveraging Power BI and structured data modeling, this dashboard transforms student behavior data into meaningful, actionable insights for educational stakeholders.
